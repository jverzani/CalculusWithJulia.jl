`Julia` package to provide notes and features for using `Julia` to address typical problems from the undergraduate calculus sequence.


The notes may be read at [calculuswithjulia.github.io](calculuswithjulia.github.io). Any suggested edits for the notes should be in a pull request to the repository [https://github.com/jverzani/CalculusWithJuliaNotes.jl/](https://github.com/jverzani/CalculusWithJuliaNotes.jl/).

The notes expect that this package is installed, as it also provides a handful of conveniences for the task.

In addition to the html pages, there are other versions of the same material that can be generated, such as `ipynb` notebooks or `pdf` files. See the `runtests.jl` file for details.

The notes may be read at [calculuswithjulia.github.io](https://calculuswithjulia.github.io).
