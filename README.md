`Julia` package to provide notes and features for using `Julia` to address typical problems from the undergraduate calculus sequence.


The notes may be read at [calculuswithjulia.github.io](https://calculuswithjulia.github.io).

The notes expect that this package is installed, as it also provides a handful of conveniences for the task.


## Contributing

This is a work in progress. To report an issue, make a comment, or suggest something new, please file an [issue](https://github.com/jverzani/CalculusWithJulia.jl/issues/). In your message add the tag `@jverzani` to ensure it is not overlooked. Otherwise, an email to `verzani` at `math.csi.cuny.edu` will also work.

To make edits to the documents directly, a pull request with the modified `*.jmd` files in the `CwJ` directory should be made. Minor edits to the `*.jmd` files should be possible through the GitHub web interface. The `*.html` files are generated using `Julia's` `Weave` package. This need not be done.
