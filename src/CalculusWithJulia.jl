    CalculusWithJulia

A package to accompany [notes](calculuswithjulia.github.io) on using Julia with calculus.

This package does two things: 1) it loads several other packages making it easier to use (and install) the functionality provided by them and 2) defines a handful of functions and plot recipes for convenience.

## Packages loaded by `CalculusWithJulia`

### Built in packages.

The value `e` is assigned to `exp(1)` and exported. The value `Base.MathConstants.e` is not used, as it can cause issue when used with `ForwardDiff`.

The `SpecialFunctions` is loaded giving access to a few special functions used in these notes, e.g., `airyai`.

The `LinearAlgebra` package is loaded for access to several of its functions for working with vectors `norm`, `cdot` (`⋅`), `cross` (`×`), `det`.

### Plotting

The `Plots` package is loaded giving access to `plot`, `scatter`, `annotate`, etc. The backends  used in the notes are `plotly`, `gr`, and `pyplot`.

The `ImplicitEquations` package is loaded for plotting implicitly defined functions.

In addition, several plot recipes are provided to ease the creation of plots:
`plotif`, `trimplot`, and `signchart` are used for plotting univariate functions;
`plot_polar` and `plot_parametric_curve` are used to plot curves in 2 or 3 dimensions;
`plot_parametric_surface` makes the plotting os parameterically defined surfaces easier;
`vectorfieldplot` and `vectorfieldplot3d` can be used to plot vector fields; and
`arrow` is a simplified interface to `quiver` that also indicates 3D vectors.


### Symbolic math

The `Sympy` package is loaded for symbolic mathematics

### Zeros of functions

The `Roots` package is loaded for its `fzero` and `fzeros` functions.

### Derivatives

The `ForwardDiff` package is loaded giving access to its  `derivative`,  `gradient`, `jacobian`, and `hessian` functions for finding automatic derivatives of functions. In addition, this package defines `'` (for functions) to return a derivative (which commits [type piracy](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/style-guide/index.html#Avoid-type-piracy-1)), `∇` to find the gradient (`∇(f)`), the divergence (`∇⋅F`). and the curl (`∇×F`), along with `divergence` and `curl`.

### Integration

This package reexports `QuadGK`, for one-dimensional integrals; `HCubature`, for multidimensional integrals; and provides `riemann`, for Riemann sums, and `fubini`, for iterated integrals over non-rectangular regions based on `QuadGK`.
